1. An interface is the boundary between a library and its clients. It provides a
   channel of communication, and acts as a barries that prevents complex details
   on one side from affecting the others. Package refers to the software that
   defines a library. The conceptual basis of a library is called an
   abstraction. Lastly, an implementation consists on the source code itself
   (mostly, but not only, for an interface).

2. TODO

3. In C, an interface is represented by a header file, which traditionally has
   the same name as the file that implements it with the .c extension replaced
   by .h
